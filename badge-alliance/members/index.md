The Badge Alliance members and contributors help grow the open badging ecosystem in an intelligent, distributed, and sustainable way. They help guide and facilitate the growth of not just the technical infrastructure supporting badging, but also the body of research on Open Badges, the messaging of badges to different audiences, badge endorsement, and more. 

Members and a broader ecosystem of collaborating organizations implement the Open Badges Specification and contribute to the development of Open Badges technology and informed practices.

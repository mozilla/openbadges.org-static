## Participating Issuers and Services to Help New Issuers

Here you'll see who’s currently issuing badges and what platforms, technical partners, and services are available to assist new Issuers.

The open structure of the badges ecosystem was designed to encourage development throughout the community. Many applications and services implement Open Badges, each with their own specialization, features, and target audiences. These Open Badges partners offer support for individuals and organizations:

+ Badge List is mobile-device compatible and completely cloud-based, so you don’t need a server or any software to use the platform. Badge List is free for public groups and small private groups.
